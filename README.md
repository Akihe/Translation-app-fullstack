# full-stack-js-project

A web-based full stack application that helps you learn English by giving you words which you translate to Finnish or vice versa.
The app tells you if your answers are correct or not. (Used to be hosted in free Heroku and available for everyone to use, unfortunately not free anymore.)
Implemented as a part of a school course during my 2nd year.
