A web-based full stack application that helps you learn English by giving you words which you translate to Finnish.
The app tells you if your answers are correct or not. Hosted in Heroku and available for everyone to use at https://full-stack-js-project.herokuapp.com/.
Implemented as a part of a school course during my 2nd year.
